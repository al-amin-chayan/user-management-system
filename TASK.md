# User Management System Project Brief

## Task
Develop a simple User Management System using PHP that allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user records following the TDD approach.

## Requirements

### 1. User Management
- Implement functionality to add new users with attributes: username, email, and password.
- Users should be able to update their information (username, email, password).
- Users should be able to delete their accounts.
- Implement basic authentication for administrators to access user management functionalities.

### 2. User Listing
- Display a list of all users with their basic information (username, email) in a tabular format.
- Allow administrators to search for users by username or email.

### 3. Security
- Implement password hashing for user passwords to enhance security.
- Prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS attacks.

### 4. User Interface
- Design a simple and user-friendly interface for the user management system.
- Use HTML and CSS for frontend layout and styling.

### 5. Persistence
- Store user records in a MariaDB database.
- Use PHP's PDO (PHP Data Objects) for interacting with the database.

### 6. Error Handling
- Implement appropriate error handling and validation for user input.

### 7. Bonus (Optional)
- Implement pagination for the user listing page to manage large numbers of users efficiently.
- Add role-based access control (e.g., admin, regular user) with different permissions.

### Additional Instructions
- PHP should be used for server-side logic, and HTML/CSS for frontend presentation.
- Use of PHP frameworks like Codeigniter, Laravel etc. is not required.
- Ensure proper validation and error handling in your code.
- Write clean and well-commented code that follows PHP best practices.

## Submission Guidelines
- Provide the source code of your solution along with any necessary SQL scripts to create the database schema.
- Include instructions on how to set up the project locally and any dependencies required.
- Create a public repository from your Github account and send us the Github link of your application. The commit history in Github will be reviewed during the evaluation of your application.
